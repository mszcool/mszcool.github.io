Last Tuesday a few of our biggest partners (CSS, Cubido and TechTalk) organized their second DevCamp conference in Vienna... and again I have to say it was a great event. While most of the sessions where delivered by peers from our partners, Max and I delivered several presentations and the key note as well.

 Btw., Max found a few really cool tools while preparing for the presentation and even better, he **created some project templates and wizards** for using the **Composite WPF Guidance** in a more effective way in Visual Studio... [check out his blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom) for the project templates and the tools...

 By clicking the links below you can download the presentation material from my sessions. As promised, I will blog a step-by-step introduction to make the .NET - Java / Glassfish WS-Trust / Identity interop-demo working in your machine in a later post...
