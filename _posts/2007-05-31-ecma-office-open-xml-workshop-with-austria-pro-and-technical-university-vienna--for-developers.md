Yesterday [Andreas](http://blogs.msdn.com/aschabus) and I delivered a developer-workshop on the [ECMA Office Open XML File Formats](http://www.ecma-international.org/news/PressReleases/PR_TC45_April2007.htm) together with **[Austria PRO](http://portal.wko.at/wk/startseite_dst.wk?AngID=1&DstID=1637)**, one of **Austria's leading standardization organization** in cooperation with Austria's chamber of economics, and the Technical University Vienna. Thanks to [Univ. Prof. Christian Huemer](http://www.big.tuwien.ac.at/staff/huemer/) from Austria PRO and TU Vienna and to [Gerhard Göschl from Microsoft Austria](http://blogs.technet.com/gerhardg) who organized the workshop.

 Andreas from our team and I did a number of in-depth presentations and demos on Office Open XML including the following topics:

 * Architecture of the ECMA Office Open XML File Formats
* Inside the System.IO.Packaging API for programmatic access to files
* Interoperability with other platforms such as Java (incl. demo:))
* WordML and solution development with Word and Custom XML islands
* SpreadSheetML and solution development with Excel File Formats
* Short overview on XSL/T and ECMA Office Open XML

 You can [download my demos here](http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/052007_OfficeOpenXML_And_AustriaPRO/OfficeOpenXmlDemos.zip) - slide-material is published on our [team-blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/msdnat), already and Andreas' demos are available on [Andreas' blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/aschabus) soon as well. It was a cool workshop and I definitely enjoyed it...
