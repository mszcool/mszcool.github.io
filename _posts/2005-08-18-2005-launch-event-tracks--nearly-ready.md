Wow, what a hard week. But we are nearly ready with defining the most important details for our launch event on November 22nd in Vienna. Currently we have planned two tracks for .NET developers and web developers, one track for database developers (SQL Server 2005 CLR, XML...) and 3 tracks covering SQL Server 2005 (DBA, BI and Upgrade, Migration and Integration) ... and of course a special track for VSTS.


Now it's just about finalizing the things. I am really looking forward to one of the most interesting launch events we ever had:)
