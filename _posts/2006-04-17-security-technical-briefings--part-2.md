Although it's nearly a week ago I feel as it was yesterday. On the second day (last Tuesday) for the train-the-trainer of our security technical briefings for customers and ISVs we covered the most important part for the briefings - security architecture.


My colleague [Andreas Schabus](http://thespoke.net/blogs/aschabus) really prepared a great session about security testing and he even wrote a ASP.NET fuzz tester. Actually the fuzz tester uncovered a little bug in the Visual Studio 2005 integrated web server... well that's penetration testing, isn't it:)


Finally when we wanted to cover the Visual C++ security parts, we figured out, that we leave them for [Christian Nagel](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cnagel) and [Andreas Schabus](http://thespoke.net/blogs/aschabus) as they both prepared those contents as well and... we beleave... they are the only ones in our group with real experience in this hard-core field of programming (I did lots of C++ things, but it's a while ago:)).


Finally we are all ready to deliver the briefings now. I am really looking forward to get the first feedbacks of customers / ISVs as content looks really great.


Thanks to all the great people that helped me setting the stage for those technical briefings...
