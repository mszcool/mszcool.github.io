Finally I made it to get to the [TechEd Europe 2004 in Amsterdam](http://www.microsoft.com/europe/teched/) - but not just as attendee :-)). If you have any questions according to .NET, ASP.NET, Web Services, security (my current favourite and special topic) or some other developer related topics you'll be able to find me at the Ask the Experts booths. Yes, that was the ticket to get there :-))


I am very glad about that as I am the first time at TechEd at all - I'll share the booths with one of my other colleagues (Georg, thanks to him - he showed me how to get there) - together we will definitely be a great team. Also my colleague, Beat, is doing some amazing sessions (I hope that I'll be able to join at least one of them). Just take a look at [his last blog entry](http://weblogs.asp.net/beatsch/archive/2004/06/13/154644.aspx).
