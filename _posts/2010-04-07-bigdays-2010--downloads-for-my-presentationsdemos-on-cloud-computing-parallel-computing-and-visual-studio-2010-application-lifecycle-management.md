Wow, what I time was that the past four weeks – BigDays 2010 preparations and rehearsals, then two-week long BigDays-tour through Austria with four sessions + key note demos on each location and now I am sitting at the airport in Zurich heading back from TechDays in Basel where I had two sessions, as well. It was such a great time, I tell you!!

 Okay, for the next week you can expect a series of postings on the presentations I gave at our BigDays-tour through our country and TechDays in Basel / Switzerland. And this is the first posting in this series – and the simplest one at the same time:)

 [For BigDays 2010, all sessions where recorded in Vienna – these recordings are available, already here.](http://www.codefest.at/post/2010/03/30/Big3eDays-2010-Developer-Sessions-zu-Web-Entwicklung-und-Visual-Studio-2010-NET-40-online!.aspx)

 Below are some infos and the download links for the presentations I had at BigDays:

 **Cloud Computing with Windows Azure Platform**It was the first session I did together with **[Rainer Stropek](http://www.software-architects.at/Blogs/tabid/72/BlogID/5/Default.aspx)** – and it was simply a great session. I hope the feedback will reflect the feelings I have about this presentation. [Rainer](http://www.software-architects.at/Blogs/tabid/72/BlogID/5/Default.aspx) and I migrated an on-premise ASP.NET web application with a local database and local file system access to Windows Azure leveraging Storage, SQL Azure, Queues and Workers. **Thanks for preparing this great demo, Rainer!!** Click on the icons below to download the demo and the presentation.

    **Voting Session – Parallel Computing with the .NET Framework 4.0**   
In many cases you get in touch with a hot topic from a totally different context. So it was with parallel computing – originally I got in touch with this topic during a project with Frequentis that was all about designing and implementing always responsive applications and services. Read more details and [my whitepaper here and the original ARC-session I delivered at several conferences including TechEd Europe](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/2009-04-alwaysresponsiveapps.pdf). At BigDays 2010 I delivered a session that focused more on the details of **Task Parallel Library**, **PLINQ** and the new ThreadPool-implementation of .NET. It was so much fun delivering this session, although at one delivery I fall into a trap during the presentation as well – it’s simply not an easy topic, but so interesting:) Click on the icons below to download the presentation and the source code of the demos I created. Furthermore take a look at the [parallel team’s blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/pfxteam/) to download the [corp-demos from there](http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/ParExtSamples).

    **Visual Studio 2010 Application Life-Cycle Management – Double-Pack with** [**Max**](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom)   
Delivering a session with [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom) is always great fun and cool. So it was this year at BigDays – the first time we delivered a session together at BigDays although we’re working in the same team for about 4 years, now (damn, time’s moving so fast)! In this session we walked through a complete life-cycle with the new features of VS 2010 in project management, architecture and especially testing. As the code was not so important during this session, I’ll publish the slides, only. [You should watch the session recording on the session.](http://www.codefest.at/post/2010/03/30/Big3eDays-2010-Developer-Sessions-zu-Web-Entwicklung-und-Visual-Studio-2010-NET-40-online!.aspx)

  If you have any further questions, feel free getting in touch with me. As mentioned, I’ll create some postings with details during the next week.
