I have created a little session voting tool for the launch conference in Austria to get a feeling of how many people will attend which sessions. With that we can split the rooms appropriately... Currently my session about web parts is on the third position with 70 votes:)) SQL CLR is the top session (86 votes) followed by SQL Server Reporting Services (75 votes).


Next we have Web Services 2.0 and WSE 3.0 (62 votes) followed by New Language features in .NET 2.0, Testmanagement with VSTS and SQL Server 2005 Management tools.
