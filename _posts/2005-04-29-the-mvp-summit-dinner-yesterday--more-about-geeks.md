The dinner with the MVPs was really funny yesterday. After a really heavy dinner we just had some great ideas about our interoffice mail (well I think [Peter](http://weblogs.asp.net/Peter_Koen) and [Christian](http://www.hauser-wenz.de/s9y/index.php?/authors/1-Christian) know what I am talking about...:-)). Oh yeah, I was espeically happy meeting [Christian (Wenz)](http://www.hauser-wenz.de/s9y/index.php?/authors/1-Christian) again yesterday at the MVP summit as well. I remembered the great road show we did last year in October / November through Austria ([ASP.NET for Web Developers](http://www.dotnetexperts.at/default.aspx?cid=a5769b71-c47a-4e9f-adc0-58a64388f402) ... or ... ASP.NET for PHP Developers;-))... with some (very) long Long Island Teas.
