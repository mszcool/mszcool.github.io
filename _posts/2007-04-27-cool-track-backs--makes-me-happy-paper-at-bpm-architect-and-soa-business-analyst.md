During the break here I tried to search the web for mszCool - just for curiosity;) There are a couple of interesting links. I am especially proud [that the last paper I've written](http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2007/02/08/white-paper-my-point-of-view-on-microsoft-s-strategies-around-service-orientation-bpm-and-esb.aspx "My point of view on Microsoft SOA") in the meantime appears at the BPM architect and SOA business analyst blogs, already. Hopefully that's a good sign...

And a list of cool VSTO blog articles where one of mine is available as well;)
