Wow, it was really hard for me blogging something in the past weeks, so many things to do... First I had to prepare content for our [local VB.NET Trainingstour](http://www.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/vbnettour.mspx) we are doing with VS 2005 and then the ISV Community day (that's gona happen tomorrow and ... well ... IBF is sooo cool but hard as well:-)) and of course some Web Casts for our trainings tour in between the actual trainings.


Today I had the first Web Cast for this VB.NET trainings tour... It's really a special experience talking more than one hour to your computer:-) but I think the demo I did on the fly is (although still Beta 1 as we use that for the tour because Beta 2 wasn't ready when we started) quite nice. I have taken a look at the channel 9 videos by Joe Stagman (<https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=21657> and <https://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=23875#23875>) and just have done a similar sample completly within the web cast on my own. Just download it [here](http://www.dotnetexperts.at/Controls/ImageView/Image.aspx?FileId=7a53f6e6-b80c-4746-93e1-a2ea20c28f57)...
