![MSDN News Flash Austria](http://www.dotnetexperts.at/Controls/ImageView/Image.aspx?FileId=cddf06fc-7233-46d3-9e6d-be5bf868019a)

 To all Austrians or those who are interested in Austrian MSDN and developer news: we will start with our local MSDN News Flash soon. If you are interested in Austrian news about local events, web casts as well as news for developers, subscribe [here](http://www.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/newsletter.mspx)!

 Many of the events announced here will be delivered by my peers or myself. Just cool if you don't want to miss anything what happens in Austria:-).
