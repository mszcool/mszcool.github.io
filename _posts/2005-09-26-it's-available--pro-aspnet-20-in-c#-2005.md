 | I have just finalized writing an article about web parts and then I was wondering if my second book is already available at Amazon. Actually it is ... although first I have seen it at PDC 2005 in L.A. in the conference shop:) 


Just take a look at it - Matthew and I have heavily invested in this book to make it one of the best books available on ASP.NET 2.0. If you have any feedback please let us know and we will provide it in the next edition. Just take a look [here](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590594967/qid=1127770530/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/002-4576803-4872064?v=glance&s=books&n=507846):)
