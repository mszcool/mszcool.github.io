As announced in the previous blog, publishing technical papers about interesting architectural concepts from customer and partner engagements is going to be a focus for me from this time forward.

This is the first paper in this series since my personal blog.restart() and it is about a WPF Smart Client enterprise project we've been working on in the past couple of months.


HP [banqpro/](http://www.banqpro.at/) is one of the most well-known banking products here in Austria and it is used by several large customers across the country. The [banqpro/](http://www.banqpro.at/)-team is currently working on a new front-end experience based on [Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)](http://wpf.netfx3.com/) and the .NET Framework 3.x.


**The white-paper I have attached to this blog describes the architectural concepts we've applied for building this WPF-based smart client. The paper especially emphasizes on motivations and architectural concepts for integrating workflows into Smart Clients of this category. It was one of the primary future requirements for [banqpro/](http://www.banqpro.at/).**


Note that this is an architectural paper - it talks about concepts and strategies, not about coding details!
