SQL Server seems to be my favourite topic at the moment :-)!


I have written an article for MSDN online, it has gone online this very moment and I am so happy about that. The article is about a generic solution for deploying MSDE with your own solutions using the new [MSDE Deployment Toolkit (RC)](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=6e9a7403-c4ba-4d98-bb0b-2c9d6414071f&DisplayLang=en)!


Search MSDN for "MSDE Deployment" and the article is (at the moment :-)) great) the first one in the result list.
