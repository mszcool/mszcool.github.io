Actually this is going to be one of the most exciting things for me this year - I will have one session and a whole-day tutorial at [JAOO Conference](http://jaoo.dk/conference/) in Denmark / Aarhus (JAOO originally stands for Java and Object Oriented... the conference itself has really been established to a well known conference for software architects now). That means talking side-by-side with industry leaders such as [Anders Hejlsberg](http://jaoo.dk/speaker/Anders+Hejlsberg), [Frank Buschmann](http://jaoo.dk/speaker/Frank+Buschmann), [Gregor Hophe](http://jaoo.dk/speaker/Gregor+Hophe) and lot's of other great people... personally for me that's a real challenge and I am really looking forward to it with some kind of nervous excitement in my stomach;)

 See [here for more details](http://jaoo.dk/speaker/Mario+Szpuszta) on the things I will do there...
