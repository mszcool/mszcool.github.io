I am especially proud to announce this next technical paper: during the past months we've been working with [www.derStandard.at](http://www.derStandard.at) on designing and implementing a [Silverlight](http://silverlight.net)-based application platform for building InfoScreen applications. 

 Special thanks goes to our developer evangelist, Max Knor, for this project - he helped making the first prototype a success with is great, in-depth Silverlight know-how.

 Max and I have written a technical white-paper together for developers and architects where we describe the basic architectural approaches as well as some Silverlight-implementation approaches that we've been working on together with the team from [derStandard.at](http://www.derstandard.at).
