Last week in our team JourFixe we had a short presentation from Barbara, event owner of the Big>Days 2007 road show, on statistics and event evaluations. I am really very happy that - in terms of session and presentaiton quality - the four top-sessions are from the developer sessions [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom) put together and organized for our tracks - congratulations:)


The first three sessions in the ranking are mine... which makes me really happy as well as putting them together was very stressful:) here are the evaluations of my sessions (1 = best, 9 = worst):



> 
> Office Developer Demo (Restaurant Community): **1,44**  
> Office SharePoint Server (Excel & InfoPath Forms Services): **1,47**  
> Web Designer meets Web Developer: **1,70**
> 
> 


The biggest surprise for me was the InfoPath and Excel session as I did not have many code in that session. But maybe the things I addressed there are solving many common problems out there:)


It was definitely a great road show and I really enjoyed it... once again, but this time with a new and great track owner. Congrats for cool developer tracks, [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom):)


***Important: if you have any feedback to the sessions and to our content in general, please contact [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom) or me through our blogs! This is much more important than the numbers above:))***
