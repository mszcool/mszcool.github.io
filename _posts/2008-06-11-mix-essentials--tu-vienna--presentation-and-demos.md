I know it's a few weeks ago, already, but now I managed to get the demos and presentation of MiX Essential and the ASP.NET workshop on the technical university of Vienna published. You can find for download them at by clicking the following links:


* [Presentation Material](http://www.mszcool.com/Blog%20Downloads/2008/05%20MixEssentials2008_Presentation.pdf)
* [Demo I've created during the events](http://www.mszcool.com/Blog%20Downloads/2008/05%20MixEssentials2008_Demo.zip)


Essentially the demo and the presentation has a focus on the following aspects:


* Summary of what's new in ASP.NET 3.5?
* New Controls in ASP.NET 3.5 (ListView and DataPager)
* LINQ Integration into ASP.NET 3.5
* AJAX Integration into ASP.NET 3.5
* Expression Web 2.0 News (just in the Demo)


I've used Expression Web 2.0 to design the web site and then Visual Studio 2008 to add "developed" content to the site. With Expression Web 2.0 I also focused on a couple of new features such as the very neat PHP integration and the Adobe Photoshop image import (unfortunately it really imports images, only;))
