Today we watched the opening key note of MWC in Barcelona where Steve Ballmer shared the first details of Windows Phone 7.

 As some of you might know, last November I bought a [Zune HD](http://www.zune.net/en-us/products/zunehd/default.htm) and I love this device:))) ... I just can say – if what they showed in the key note gets into my hands soon and if its really the same high quality as Zune HD I will love this phone...
