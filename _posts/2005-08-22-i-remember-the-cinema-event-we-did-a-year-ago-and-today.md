...we are doing another one together with [MSDN Connection Austria](https://s.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/connection/default.mspx). But this time we are doing it the other way round: first go to cinema, then code something and finally win one of three really cool prices if you are one of the three best coders... 


The first 500 registrations for [MSDN Connection Austria](https://s.microsoft.com/austria/msdn/connection/default.mspx) will get a **free ticket for** [**a cool film**](http://www.skip.at/AT/filme/filminfo_ev.php?filmnr=7052) and get the possibility of **participating in a coding contest** we will introduce at the cinema right before the film starts (yes, as developer I can't do just a movie in cinema without some content for developers before:) ... so you will get some interesting and funny security-related information before the film starts... to prepare you for the coding-contest;))


It would be really cool meeting you at the cinema ... and challenging (oh yes, I will participate as well) you at the coding contest afterwards...
