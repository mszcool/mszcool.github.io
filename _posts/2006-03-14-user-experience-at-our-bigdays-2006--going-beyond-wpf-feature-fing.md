I have just finished putting together the content four our next MSDN Flash - except the editorial. Actually I wanted to write some more things about user experience.


Then I remembered, that I will do the Windows Presentation Foundation developer session at [Big>Days](http://www.microsoft.com/austria/events/bigdays/default.mspx) (see more content details on [Haralds blog](/leitenmu/archive/2006/03/09/547213.aspx)). I already did a couple of samples, demos and presentations on that topic and I think I know some features fearly well. But all these presentations had one commonality: they where all about WPF hard-core features. Yes, cool features, for hard-core developers. But I think features are not worth the time when not thinking about scenarios.


Actually I got some ideas from customer projects I was involved where applications should "show the user's" through animationsÂ what they need to do. But at the end the story is a little bit more, isn't it?


Honestly although I think talking about user experience is really a very important thing. Bringing together **productivity-aspects** and especially **emotional aspects** is essential! Whether we want to have it or not! It's true and for users it makes the difference between just good and really cool applications (yes, do you think users will either talk about good or cool applications?).


I really want to do a presentation developers really like and find useful at Big>Days! Personally for that I'd combine usage scenarios in context of user experience with technical education. But honestly I am afraid that developers might find "user experience" as marketing...


At the end I am not quite sure, which strategy I should go for structuring the presentation - the classic feature-by-feature (which I know works in most cases) or a scenario based (which requires me to really focus on "user experience" and let the technology be just a "tool for getting it done") presentation.


So... what I want to do, is, leaving it up to you - the attendee! Please give me feedback of what you would expect in my WPF session to see and if you rather would like to go for it feature-by-feature or through sharing new ideas and concepts about leveraging the technology for next-generation user experience...


Any comment would be really great and would help me creating a presentation which is really useful to YOU... I will read each and every comment to this blog and will integrate it thoroughly into my presentation - promised!!


Oh yeah, and if you have any crazy ideas about special scenarios for animations, videos in buttons (joke:)) or similar things - share your ideas with me and we'll discuss about them...
