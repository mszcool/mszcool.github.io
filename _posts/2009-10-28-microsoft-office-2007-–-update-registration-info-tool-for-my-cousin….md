My cousin wanted to update the registration-information specified while installing Microsoft Office 2007. When he asked me I realized, that for the default values of user name and the initials Office 2007 offers a UI – but it doesn’t provide a possibility to update the company name. Furthermore I realized, that PowerPoint reads the information from the Installer-Data registry-hive.

 So I created a little tool for him to update all registration information to have the right default values for Word, Excel and PowerPoint (haven’t tested with the other tools;)).

 [Download the source code for the tool here.](http://www.mszcool.at/blog/2009/20091028_OfficeProperties_Src.zip)

 [Download the binary for executing the tool directly, here.](http://www.mszcool.at/blog/2009/20091028_OfficeProperties_bin.zip)

 I know, it’s not an architect’s job writing such little tools... but almost too often I love doing these little things:)) ... little fun stuff:))
