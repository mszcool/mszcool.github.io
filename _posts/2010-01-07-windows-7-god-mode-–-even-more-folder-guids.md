If you’ve read my [previous post](http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/archive/2010/01/04/winhappy-new-year-2010-a-gift-windows-7-god-mode.aspx) on Windows 7 God-Mode, there are a number of further special folder short-cuts you can use in a similar way. The complete list of GUIDs for the special folder short cuts can be found on MSDN here:
