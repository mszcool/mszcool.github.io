Yesterday I visited Ernst & Young in Prague for a Workshop on the variety of LINQ technologies. Thanks to my TechEd Presenters of the Tools & Languages Track last November 2007 (Luca, Luke and Mike) I was able to give a good workshop based on their deliverables. You can download the demos I've created by clicking the following link:
