I am currently setting up my Windows Vista 5472 for the upcoming customer meetings this week and next week. When I wanted to install the typical sysinternal tools I figured out that that's not necessary anymore for some of them. Through Windows Task Manager you can launch the Resource monitor... just cool:))

I know, it's just a little one - but many of such little ones are definitely nice...
