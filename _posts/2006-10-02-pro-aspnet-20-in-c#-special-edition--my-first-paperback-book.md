This summer during my vacation we finished our work for [the special edition of Pro ASP.NET 2.0 in C#](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&s=books). And it's available [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-2005-Special/dp/1590597680/sr=8-1/qid=1159813384/ref=sr_1_1/104-7112221-6902344?ie=UTF8&s=books) already. It was really hard work as Apress wanted us to do this in a very short amout of time. We extended the book with some great content based on the feedback we've got in the past months from readers and during real-world projects. And we addressed the AJAX hype and unveiled more technical details on AJAX in ASP.NET incl. ATLAS preview. And it's finally our first paper-back book:)...

Some of the extensions (besides to the CD with all the samples as well as eBook versions of 18 other Apress titles) we've included are:


* Web Application Project for easier migrating ASP.NET 1.x applications
* Web Deployment Project for a more streamlined compilation model using aspnet\_merge.exe
* Creation of MSI setup packages (which is still interesting for ISVs who are creating products)
* Additions to advanced Web Parts such as dynamically loading user controls and exporting and importing web parts between different web part pages
* Using Membership in WinForms applications
* Custom Resource Providers if you want to manage your localization resources in a database instead of the .resx files
* ***More details on the ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX infrastructure and low-level AJAX component development***
* ***A detailled chapter on [ASP.NET ATLAS](http://atlas.asp.net/) (which will finally now will be released by end of this year)***
