As you probably know Beta 2 is shipping as DVD-Box around the world now. It also includes the WeFly247 trainings DVD. If you have any feedback or questions to my recordings on the DVD (I have done the whole XML and Security track as well as some of the Smart Client track sessions) feel free posting the feedback and questions here on my blog!



You can order trainings DVD from *Beta Experience* (<http://www.microsoft.com/emea/msdn/betaexperience/>) on the sub-web for your country as well, I think it's definitely worth taking a look at it...

Thanks a lot for any feedback :-)
