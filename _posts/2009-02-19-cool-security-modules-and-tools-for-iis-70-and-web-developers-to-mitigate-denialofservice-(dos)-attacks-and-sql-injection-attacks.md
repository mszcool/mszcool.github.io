By "accident" I've found two older articles on some extensions and tools for [Internet Information Services 7.0](http://iis.net) and web developers in general that help improving security of web applications. 

 I was so amused and excited about these new modules that I thought I have to write a short entry this morning:) Also it really demonstrates, in my opinion, that the new modularized architecture of IIS 7.0 really rocks. That is really underpinned by the fact that you really find new modules and new functionality published either by the community through <http://iis.net> or by Microsoft itself in regular intervals.

 The articles I've found aren't new, but I really love this kind of functionality - take a look at the following independent articles:

 * [Module for fighting against DoS attacks (click here)](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/02/microsoft-releases-beta-tool-for-fighting-dos-attacks.ars)
* [Analysis Tools for uncovering SQL Injection issues (click here)](http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/06/microsoft-offers-tools-for-fighting-sql-injection-attacks.ars)

 I think, these tools are really useful helpers and they can provide an additional security gatekeeper in your security architecture - you should definitely take a look at them;)
