During an internal conference – Envision – this week I have attended several architecture sessions about Service Oriented Architecture, Architectural patterns and so forth. Most of them have been interesting, but two have been a far-reaching experience for me. The sessions I am talking about are *Metropolis* from Pat Helland (haven't found a blog - if there is one, I'd be interested in) and an architectural site meeting hosted by [Michael Platt](http://weblogs.asp.net/michael_platt) and [Keith Short](http://blogs.msdn.com/keith_short). Those sessions started me thinking about how my understanding of architecture has changed in the past and currently is changing at all.xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /?


 




My first thoughts of “architecture” were completely different – I thought about things like class design, design patterns or logical database design as primary tasks of an architect. And – quite amazing – this understanding completely changed during the last one and a half year. I recognized that “being an architect” has much more facings than I originally thought – class design or database design are only a couple of trees within a large forest. The forest consists of different applications within the company, across companies; it includes the network infrastructure and its architecture and so on and so forth. But in terms of so many different layers of architecture – within applications, between applications, mapping to infrastructure and so forth – the forest view is much larger than I even can imagine now...
