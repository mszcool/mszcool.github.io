Well, just back from vacation and I am finding myself deep in content planning for our big **launch event on November 22nd 2005 in Vienna** (yes, if you are interested, save this date because it's already fixed!!!). We really want to do a one-day developer conference with in-depth content for our developer and architects community. Actually it would be really helpful getting some input from anybody out there in the Austrian developer community. So if you have any topic you'd prefer having in a session at our launch conference just post a comment to this blog entry and I'll keep it in mind for the content plan.


But comment quickly because I want to finalize the content plan this week ;)


Thanks for any comments...
