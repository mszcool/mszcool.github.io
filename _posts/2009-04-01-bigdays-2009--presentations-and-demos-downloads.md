Yesterday we had the last delivery of our BigDays road show for 2009. It was a pleasure participating for me being a part of this largest road show through Austria, again.

 This year I delivered two sessions, one on **Windows Communication Foundation** and one on **ASP.NET web development** (the second one together with Alex Duggleby from [Security Research](http://www.securityresearch.at)). The presentations are available for download under the following two links:

 * [Session on Windows Communication Foundation](http://cid-c57a431d03937fc0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/200903%20BigDays%202009/Track3%7C_Session2%7C_WCF.pdf)
* [Session on ASP.NET Web Development](http://cid-c57a431d03937fc0.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/200903%20BigDays%202009/Track3%7C_Session3%7C_ASPNET.pdf)

 Both sessions were part of an idea Max and I had on developing a complete scenario demo application through all sessions of the track. 

 Btw. Max delivered great sessions in all developer tracks around the conference - for details [take a look at his blog entry;)](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom/archive/2009/03/22/slides-and-demos-from-bigdays-2009-are-online.aspx)

 **The Rent-A-Worker Demo Application**

 The demo-scenario application was the Rent-A-Worker demo application. We published the whole application as an open-source project on codeplex:

 [Click here to get to the Rent-A-Worker project!](http://bigdays09.codeplex.com/)

 It is supposed to be used for finding workers and machines and renting them for your own building projects. The application was architecturally built with the following layers in mind. Each session in the track was dedicated to a single layer of the application:

 **Which technologies did we use for implementing Rent-A-Worker?**

 This year's BigDays were - based on the feedback from customers last year - focused towards **released technologies** and not any future technologies. Therefore we built our demo scenario with .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 in all layers (released in 2008). Below you find the technologies incl. links to downloads for the pre-requisites you need to run, test and extend the Rent-A-Worker demo application:

 **Feedback, Questions?**

 If you have any feedback to the track, to Rent-A-Worker or the content itself feel free getting in touch with [Max](http://blogs.msdn.com/knom) and me through our blogs. We would be more than happy about feedback on the whole track, our sessions, demos, contents, about what we should keep doing and what we should stop doing etc.

 Cheers
