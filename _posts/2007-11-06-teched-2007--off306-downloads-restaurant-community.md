I thought I'll publish the demos of my TechEd sessions... so IÂ am writing kind of in a *time-travel-style* here;).

 I hope you enjoyed the littel fun-demo-session on Wednesday at TechEd in Barcelona on Office Development. Here you can find the complete VS2008 solution and demo parts that I used for building the litte community solution with SharePoint, VSTO 2008 and Office Open XML...

 I'd be happy about any feedback personal feedback on this session as the numbers and scores are often not enough to really improve things;) Looking forward to meet you next year again...
