Tomorrow, after a customer meeting in Linz, I'll directly head to the airport traveling to Brussels for giving a presentation on Office in a Service Oriented World for the European Union. I've prepared a bunch of interoperability demos I'll share after the conference on my blog for really showing interop of Office with other platforms at several levels. I'll access (self-written) Java Web Services from within Office, I'll access SharePoint Web Services from within Java and finally I'll use Java to automatically generate Office Open XML File Formats. Wow, it was a long time ago when I touched Java for the last time, but for these interoperability demos I've written my first Java applications after more than 5 years of Java-break... that was fun (and sometimes pain)...

 Honestly, I am a little bit nervous:) Hope everything's going right on Friday as I really worked hard for getting the really good intnerop-message across...
