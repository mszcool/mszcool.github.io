The last three weeks we primarily spend with our official launch tour for Windows Vista and 2007 Microsoft Office system for IT professionals, developers and architects traveling through the whole country.

 Now right back again and just a couple of ours from the next .NET 3.0 event away ([Global Knowledges](http://www.globalknowledge.at/ "Global Knowledge Austria") and [Christian Nagel's](http://blogs.thinktecture.com/cnagel/ "Christians Blog") [Take Off Developer Day](http://www.globalknowledge.at/neuigkeiten/veranstaltungen/software_developent_day.aspx "Take Off Developer Day")) I found a slot for uploading my demos and slides. You find the links for downloading all the demos and slides in this blog post!

 ***Web Developer meets Web Designer***[Slides Download](http://www.microsoft.at/admp/737958F9-CAD9-4CB1-AF2A-ABF279F42A19/track3_session2_Web+Designer+Meets+Web+Developer.pdf "Web Designer Slides"), [Demos Download](http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/042007_BigDays/WebDesignerDeveloper.zip "Web Designer Demos")  
This session really demonstrated how you can design web sites with Microsoft Expression Web and then add value to web sites by developing add-ons using Visual Studio 2005 by using Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 AJAX Extensions and the AJAX Control Toolkit.

 ***Demo Requirements:*** All you need for running this demo is having Visual Studio 2005 or Microsoft Expression Web and SQL Server 2005 Express Edition installed as I've modified the demo to use file-based database access.

 ***Developing Solutions using InfoPath Forms Services and Excel Server Services***[Slides Download](http://www.microsoft.at/admp/6FC112A5-5BB1-44E0-96FB-A5FC8122FA09/Track4_Session4_Office+SharePoint+Server.pdf "Office Server Slides"), [Demos Download](http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/042007_BigDays/OfficeServerSession.zip "Office Server Demos")  
Have you ever tried running Excel in a clustered server environment? No!? That's something you really can do now with Excel Services. It allows you running complex Excel calculations in a clustered environment and integrate logic modelled in Excel into custom applications by using the Excel Web Services interface. Furthermore you can make Excel Sheets available in the browser using the new Excel Web Access - this time based on pure-fashioned ASP.NET 2.0 web sites (and not the old ActiveX stuff anymore!!). Browser based access is possible with InfoPath Forms Services as well.

 ***Demo Requirements:*** To run the demos of this session you need a developer machine running Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 client, Excel 2007 client, Windows SharePoint Services v3 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 incl. InfoPath Forms Services and Excel Services installed. I've used the single-box installation mode of Office SharePoint Server with the integrated SQL Server 2005 Express Edition - that's the easiest way for getting a demo environment running without the need of digging into the details of configuring SharePoint, too much. I've furthermore created a separate site collection running on <http://localhost:9091> to separate the things from the demo site created by default.

 ***Restaurant Community in 70 min. - Demo-Only Session***[Slides Download](http://www.microsoft.at/admp/D649796E-CD7E-4EFB-BCFB-646B07CE043B/Track4_session5_Office+Developer+Demo.pdf "Restaurant Community Slides"), [Demos Download](http://mszcool.members.winisp.net/Demos/042007_BigDays/OfficeRestaurantSolution.zip "Restaurant Demo")  
As the last fifth session in the Office track of the day was fairly late I did not want to bother any attendees with **P**ower**P**oint**T**errorismE**x**tended (pptx:)) anymore. Therefore I decided we take parts of the things you learned throughout the day in the Office Developer track to develop a restaurant community solution. In the demo-downloads I've also included the SharePoint Site Template to give you a chance to recover the SharePoint lists and libraries I've created during the session, quickly. You just need to upload the ***RestaurantsCommunity.stp*** file to your site templates and then you can create new sites of type "RestaurantCommunity" on your own SharePoint instance.

 ***Demo Requirements:*** To run the demos of this session you need a developer machine running Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 client, Microsoft Word 2007, Visual Studio 2005 Tools for Office Second Edition, Windows SharePoint Services v3 and Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 incl. InfoPath Forms Services installed. I've used the single-box installation mode of Office SharePoint Server with the integrated SQL Server 2005 Express Edition. I've furthermore created a separate site collection running on <http://localhost:9091> to separate the things from the demo site created by default. Therefore for getting the Word Add-In working you need to update the URLs in the application configuration file using the Properties-Folder of the solution explorer of Visual Studio 2005 within the add-in project.
