Wow, it was a busy time the past months since I switched from Developer&Platform Evangelism to Microsoft Services for becoming a senior architect working with the largest enterprise accounts. At the same time I delivered this [presentation at JAOO](http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2010/speaker/Mario+Szpuszta) and took, for one last time, a track ownership responsibility for TechEd Europe.

 Nevertheless I am back and I want to start with providing the material I’ve presented at [JAOO](http://gotocon.com) (renamed to [goto;)](http://gotocon.com)) back in October on [ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc). It was really an introductory session (but very technical![Smile](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/MSDNBlogsFS/prod.evol.blogs.msdn.com/CommunityServer.Blogs.Components.WeblogFiles/00/00/00/32/26/metablogapi/0576.wlEmoticon-smile_75310367.png?raw=true)) on ASP.NET Model-View-Controller for about 100 people and it was a great pleasure being back in Aarhus, Denmark.
