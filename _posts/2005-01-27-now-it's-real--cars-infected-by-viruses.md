When I read that the first time I simply couldn't believe it. But it's true ... cars can be infected by mobile viruses via mobile phones - just take a closer look at the following article: <http://www.infosecnews.com/news/index.cfm?fuseaction=newsDetails&newsUID=bc5789cf-e448-4a6e-bee9-a5dd291405ed&newsType=News>

 I think Threat Models get more and more interesting in mobile space. But I didn't thought about a threat model for my car :-), yet... well but it's definetly good having one in place:-)...
