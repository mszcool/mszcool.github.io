Well, one none-technical article as an exception;)

 Since last Friday right after the press-conference in New York and the official announcement during Redbull’s media evening in Kitzbühel, [Robert John](http://john-robert.com/), Lukas Cudrigh and I are especially proud of 

 <http://www.redbullstratos.com> (full site)

 <http://m.redbullstratos.com> (mobile site incl. iPhone support)

 [Robert](http://john-robert.com/) started the conversation right after an enterprise briefing organized by the account team with Redbull media house **about 6 months ago**.

 The [Stratos web site](http://www.redbullstratos.com) is hopefully just the first visible step of a number of great and innovative projects.

 Although **I was just a little technical help** to make this project real (did some prototyping with Silverlight and also Bing maps etc. but the real implementation of the whole web presence is and was done by [Terralever](http://www.terralever.com) together with Microsoft corp. and Lukas’ team), I think [![Photo-0030[1]](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/RedbullStratosFelixBaumgartnerhismission_C712/Photo-0030%5B1%5D_thumb.jpg?raw=true?raw=true "Photo-0030[1]")](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/RedbullStratosFelixBaumgartnerhismission_C712/Photo-0030%5B1%5D_2.jpg?raw=true?raw=true) together (and especially Robert who sat in lots of nightly conference calls with Lukas to finalize the contracts and all related things in time) we can be very proud of this. It’s so great working with a company like Redbull who is really strong in “just doing cool things” (what is very untypical for Austria;)).

 I hope you’ll see some of the other things we’ve started, very soon...

 It’s pretty cool being part of this scientific trip;)
