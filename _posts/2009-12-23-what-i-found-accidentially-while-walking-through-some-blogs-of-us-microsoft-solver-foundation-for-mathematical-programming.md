Sometimes live as a Microsoft-employee is really strange, especially when you find something from Microsoft (!!) that you’ve never heard about as an employee, before – in particular if the thing you’ve found is cool as well.

 If you’re a mathematics freak or someone who builds statistical BI-stuff for your CxO you might want to check out **Microsoft Solver Foundation:** <http://www.solverfoundation.com/>

 Sounds pretty cool, especially as I remember I built at least a matrix-calculation framework in C++ about 10 years ago for a customer for a transport-optimization-system, as well. My heart is rushing:)))
