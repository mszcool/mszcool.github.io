Just before I go on vacation for a week (yes that's short:)) - this is really a cool site. When you take a look at it first you won't even believe that it has something to do with SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Explore it, it's really funny:). Play a little bit with it, maybe you find clips like [this](http://www.escapeyesterworld.com/downloads/videos/high/evil_wears_cape_300.wmv) one there...
