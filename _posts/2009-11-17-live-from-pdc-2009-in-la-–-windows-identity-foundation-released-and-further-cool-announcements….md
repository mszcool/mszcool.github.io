Kim gave a very interesting update on Microsoft’s Identity strategies.

 With that, building claims-aware applications on the .NET platform for heterogeneous environments gets reality. And guess what, now at PDC 2009 they also announced what I’ve been waiting for a while now as customers are requesting that again and again:

 * [![PICT3696](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/Livefr.WindowsIdentityFoundationReleased_C8A/PICT3696_thumb.jpg?raw=true?raw=true "PICT3696")](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/Livefr.WindowsIdentityFoundationReleased_C8A/PICT3696.jpg?raw=true?raw=true) Microsoft Dynamics CRM “5” will support claims based on WIF for on-premise, hosted and cloud-instances.
* SharePoint 2010 now has officially announced, that they will have claims-support built-into the SharePoint-platform. That means, using SharePoint in heterogeneous environments will get much easier. To give you a short impression, just see the image right to this bullet-point from a session I am attending right now on claims in SharePoint 2010...

 A few further announcements I found really interesting in addition to the “cases” SharePoint 2010 and CRM “5”, that were mentioned in the key note today, as well, are

 * [![PICT3685](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/Livefr.WindowsIdentityFoundationReleased_C8A/PICT3685_thumb.jpg?raw=true?raw=true "PICT3685")](https://github.com/mszcool/oldmsdnblogarchive/blob/master/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/mszcool/WindowsLiveWriter/Livefr.WindowsIdentityFoundationReleased_C8A/PICT3685.jpg?raw=true?raw=true) Work on a REST-based authentication kit to support claims for simpler, REST-based scenarios (AJAX etc.) called **OAuth Web Resource Authorization Protocol (WRAP)** where Microsoft, Google and Yahoo are working together (interesting, but cool;))
* Support for Simple Web Tokens (SWT) based on OAuth WRAP.
* LiveID will become an **OpenID provider** during the calendar year 2010 as you can see in the image above.
* CardSpace and OpenID alignment in terms to be able to select an OpenID as an easy-to-understand information card from your digital CardSpace wallet in CY 2010.

 These are pretty cool news for anyone interested or working on claims-based security...
