Today I travelled a little bit for the *Microsoft Global Account Team* and the *EMEA Microsoft Services* team... to Warsaw to visit [Ernst & Young](http://www.ey.com/global/content.nsf/International/Home).


We did a whole day workshop on ASP.NET 2.0... starting at 09:30. Around 9:45 I started the first demo and finished of with it shortly before 11:45. Then we decided to continue just doing demos - so finally it was a whole day showing them, what's in ASP.NET 2.0. Great workshop, but still there would have been so many things to show them.


If you are interested in the demos, [just download them here](http://blogs.msdn.com/mszcool/attachment/730636.ashx). The examples cover typical things such as MasterPages, Themes, the new Data Source controls including ObjectDataSource, SqlCacheDependency, Resources and Localization including a custom, localizable control, dynamically switching Themes at runtime and the most important control news.


The demos are ready-to-run when you have VS 2005 and SQL 2005 Express Edition installed (databaseÂ in App\_Data, connectionString goes to (local)\SQLExpress).
