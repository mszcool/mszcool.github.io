Maybe some of you know this for a longer period of time, already. But for me it was just new - ***a plug-in for Mozilla Firefox that allows you to install .NET Framework ClickOnce applications**.* That's a nice tool...

 You can find it [here...](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1608)
