Today based on some customer project requirements, [Max](http://www.knor.net/blog) and I together created a very simple and easy-to-understand **all-in-one** demo to show, how-to integrate Internet Explorer 8 features into your own web sites.

 [Download the sample web site here!](http://www.mszcool.at/blog/2009/20091030_IE8Integration.zip)

 As for us the localization of the content for our local audience was core, we published the whole documentation in German on our local team-blog including detailed explanations and code-snippets.

 [Take a look at the article in German on our team-blog here!](http://www.codefest.at/post/2009/10/30/Internet-Explorer-8-Integration-von-Web-Slices-Accelerators-und-Open-Search-in-Web-Pages-e28093-How-To!!.aspx)

 Generally speaking, in my opinion these new little gimmicks in IE8 are pretty cool for end users and are more than easy to be integrated into your web pages... and they do not disturb any other browsers, at all. So for me that’s just a win-win-situation...
