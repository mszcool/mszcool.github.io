This week I meet more cool geeks and speakers from Europe than the whole last year;-) First we had our Whidbey Ascend training which was really great and ISVs and Enterprise customers participated on the training really liked it. Of course no surprise when having [Christian Weyer](http://weblogs.asp.net/cweyer/), [Christian Nagel](http://weblogs.asp.net/cnagel/) and [Clemens Vasters](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/) as trainers ... they have really delivered hard core cool content. Oh yes, and I think we (as the small sub;-)) are the only sub where every single attendee (44!!) got a specifically for the training prepared VPC image on DVD I prepared together with a colleague overnight (thanks to Stefan from our IT department;-)).


And today we are hosting the europe MVP summit here. I am really happy having experts like [Ingo Rammer](http://www.thinktecture.com/staff/ingo/weblog/) (thank you for giving me the chance of becoming the Co-Author of your great book Advanced .NET Remoting for the 2nd edition ... I really liked working with Ingo:-)), [Hannes Preishuber](http://weblogs.asp.net/hpreishuber/), [Christoph Wille](http://chrison.net/) and lots of other geeks from the MVP community. I am really waiting for an evening full of fun today as we have planned a typical Austrian dinner with hopefully lots of beer for them.
