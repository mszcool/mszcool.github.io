Together with Andreas Hejl from Siemens we were able to organize superb speakers for the conference.

 I think this could be a great platform for experience-exchange, for discussing technical and conceptual ideas and for getting the latest and greatest information on Microsoft’s strategies for hot topics such as

 **Cloud Computing   
Parallel Computing**   
**Patterns & Practices   
Methodologies & Processes**

 The speakers we’ve organized are international and local industry experts which are not coming to Austria so often:) To name just a few of them:

 **Ulrich Homann, Chief Architect Microsoft Services World Wide   
Dr. Michael Stal, Senior Principal Engineer & Team Lead, Siemens Corporate Research   
Beat Schwegler, Enterprise Lead, Microsoft Western Europe Head Quarters   
Mitch Lacey, Mitch Lacey & Associates Inc., International Expert on Agile   
Christian Weyer, Co-Founder, Thinktecture, Microsoft Regional Director Germany   
Ralf Westphal, Most Valued Professional for Microsoft, Germany**

 But of course the conference lives and dies with YOU – architects and architecture-interested people which are willing to challenge our presenters, discuss with them and exchange opinions and experience.

 I am looking forward to meet you at this conference – it is going to be a special event for several reasons as things are going to change for me right now;)… so don’t miss this conference, join us with this highlight of our architecture community…
