Do you remember my posts back from April 2006... during my prep-works for our local BigDays 2006 road show I discovered - with some limitations in mind - that sidebar gadgets can be created with Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) via an IFRAME work-around.


See my two posts

Now I was curios if that still works with RTM of Vista and .NET Framework 3.0 because between February CTP and Beta 2 it did not work... and fortunately while searching a little bit, someone else was brave enough trying this, already. [Karsten Januszewski](http://blogs.msdn.com/karstenj) tried this already and blogged about it in great detail in [within a fantastic posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/karstenj/archive/2006/10/04/WPF-Vista-Gadgets-_2D00_-Part-1_3A00_-Using-XBAP-and-IFRAME.aspx). Take a look at what he figured out [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/karstenj/archive/2006/10/04/WPF-Vista-Gadgets-_2D00_-Part-1_3A00_-Using-XBAP-and-IFRAME.aspx). He clearly mentions what the limitations are - but honestly, for some situations I definitely can live with these limitations:))
