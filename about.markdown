I am a passionate father and family member honred by my lovely spouse and
two kids, my daughter (born 2016) and my son (born 2014). As a professional,
I am working at **Microsoft** as engineering manager who enjoys working with a
talented team hands-on. We're part of **Azure Global Commercial Industries**,
a unit at Microsoft that's building **Industry PaaS platforms**.

Back in 1999 after completing a **Higher Technical Education** for **informatics**
and **economics** in Austria with the final examl focused on **Oracle** and **Java**.
After that, I started working as a self-employed developer next to civil service.
From there, I joined a small consulting team that was building banking software
for customers in Austria incl. the Austrian Nations Bank or Compaq (later HP).
**Windows DNA**, **COM+ and COM** with both, **VB6**, **C++** and **Oracle** where my bread & butter.

From there, I moved on to a company that was working on **SAP Integration
projects**. I got exposed to SAP, especially **SAP's Business Connector** and **iDOCs**,
the dominant integration platforms long before times of SAP Netweaver and SAP HANA.
One of the projects got me into **.NET** (back in 2001) and **BizTalk** - a path that
formed the next years to come.

## Starting at Microsoft in 2002

Since October 2002 I am a passionate technician at Microsoft. In the years I've
learned a lot through different jobs, roles and responsibilities.

Starting as a Developer Evangelist in the Austrian Developer & Platform Evangelism group, I worked
in none-traditional technical pre-sales to help large customers adopting **.NET** and
**SQL Server (2000, 2005)**. I went through evolutions of this role incl. working
with ISVs on Office Client and Office Server Integrations with .NET (**VSTO**, **SharePoint**).
In 2007, I was a founding member of the Austrian Microsoft Interoperability Council
working on integration of Microsoft-tech in open, local and regional standards such
as **egora (Austrian e-Gov Reference Architecture)**, **WCF SOAP messaging integration**
for the Austrian e-card system or Identity interoperability across **CA Siteminder**
and **Active Directory Federation Services** for several Austrian organizations incl.
the Austrian Chamber of Economics.

### SOA Transition for the IAEA

My next step lead me to **Microsoft Consulting Services** and working with the
**International Atomic Energy Agency** on a SOA Transformation project as an enterprise
architect. This work was mainly focused on Business/IT-alignment and establishing SOA
architecture and design principles with the teams working at the IAEA. Since I am a
hands-on person, I worked with a team to prototype some of the approaches we designed
for practical validation purposes. But my main tools in this time where **Business Capability Maps**,
**Business Dependency Maps** and the likes. Practical validation involved things such as
**Web Services Software Factory** or **Composite UI Application Block** to verify
lose coupling of services and corresponding client development efforts.

### Azure Incubation for Independent Software Vendors

The next step laid the ground for where I am, today. As much as I enjoyed the work
at the IAEA (back in 2010/11), the cloud was not something of interest for them at that
time. This lead me to pro-actively join the Corporate Evangelism teams at Microsoft,
in specific a team called Azure Incubation. That team worked with helping ISVs to get
bootstrapped with Azure in early days. Main focus was on the original versions of
**Azure PaaS (Web/Worker Roles)**. This role involved **architecting**, **designing**
and **prototyping** the on-boarding of ISV applications into Azure. My main areas
of activity included **Austria** (obviously:)) and **Switzerland**.

### Corp. Technical Evangelism & Development

Azure Incubation graduated and merged with the Microsoft Corporate Global ISV team
into an org called **Technical Evangelism and Development (short: TED)**. TED was
an engineering organization fostering co-engineering with partners and customers.
Our teams worked on building software with and for those partners and customers
to help them succeed on Azure. As part of that job we implemented first **automations
based on PowerShell** for setting-up **SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machines** across
multiple regions with **Always-On Availability Groups**. It included building
a scalable batch processing framework for ISVs before there was something like
**Azure Batch** available (we called it **GeRes** which stands for **Generic
Resource Scheduler For Azure** ... it was a **batch processing framework** written in
**.NET** utilizing **Azure Web/Worker roles** that some of our ISVs ran with ~800
active instances processing data back in 2014).

### SAP Alliance Team @ Microsoft Global ISV

Working from about 2013-2015 with mid-sized Global ISVs, in 2015 I joined the
**Global SAP Alliance Team** becoming one of the main technical counterparts at
Microsoft for SAP closely collaborating with the SAP engineering team of Microsoft
and with SAP engineering groups across the world. During that time, I traveled way
more than I wanted to. But the work was extremely interesting. My main contribution
was **working with SAP Israel** to finally **onboard and ship SAP Cloud Platform
on Azure**.

Technical Evangelism & Development later evolved into Commercial Software Engineering (CSE)
at Microsoft - an exciting new team for which we formed the foundation for. Before
CSE got formed, I moved on, though.

### Azure Global / Engineering

During that work with SAP I transitioned to Azure Engineering into the Azure
Customer Advisory Team (AzureCAT). At the time (2017), the team was focused
on working with the most challenging Azure Customers world-wide with the goal
to help those customers, but especially learn from them and help core engineering
teams to improve Azure as a platform itself.

AzureCAT was re-organized into where my team and I are ended up in 2019 - Azure
Global (short AG). AG is responsible for global ecosystem and region build-out.
In 2020, AG took on an additonal charter: build industry PaaS products which do
make Azure a differentiated platform for industries such as AgriFood, Financial,
Energy etc.

Today, I am leading a team of 6 engineers working on co-engineering
projects with customers as well as feature engineering in our future industry PaaS
offerings. We are working with **C#**, **Python**, **Azure Cosmos DB**, **Kubernetes**,
**Azure Data Explorer**, **Azure Synapse** and the likes to build platforms
that will enable true digital transformation across our core industries.
